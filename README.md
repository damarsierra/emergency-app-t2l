Emergency App
-
The app runs off of the main.dart file. Works only on Android phones, versions 10 and up.

Code Organization
-
Everything that was originally created is stored under the lib folder. There are multiple sub-folders that house different parts of the app.

Within the /screens folder are all of the app's screens, which are each housed in their own folder, organized based on their path and function.

Within the /theme folder is the style.dart file that contains the global styling for the app (for the overall look, buttons, and text inputs).

The main.dart file is what initializes the app, and routes.dart initializes the routes between screens.
